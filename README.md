# Blinkit_Sales_analysis
I'm thrilled to present my latest data analyst project, where I delved into the sales data of Blinkit and gained valuable insights. This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my skills and enhance my expertise in data analysis.

Tools and Techniques Used:
To create this comprehensive dashboard, I utilized DAX, Power BI, and Excel. These tools allowed me to clean, analyze, and visualize the data effectively, providing valuable insights that can drive strategic decisions. Here’s a glimpse into the process and the outcomes:
Process:
1. Data Collection: Gathered sales data from various sources and consolidated it into Excel.
2. Data Cleaning: Ensured data accuracy and consistency by cleaning and transforming the data in Excel.
3. Data Modeling: Used DAX to create calculated columns and measures for deeper analysis.
4. Visualization: Leveraged Power BI to design an interactive and visually appealing dashboard

Objectives and Solutions
1. Increase Total Sales:
Focus on high-performing outlet types and locations. Tier 3 locations have the highest sales (₹472.1K), and Supermarket Type 1 has the highest sum of sales (₹7,87,550.0). Investing more in these areas could further boost sales.
2. Improve Average Sales per Transaction:
Encourage customers to buy more items per transaction. The average sales per transaction is currently 141. Implementing bundle deals or discounts for bulk purchases could help increase this number.
3. Enhance Customer Satisfaction:
Improve the average rating, which is currently 3.9. This can be achieved by enhancing customer service, ensuring product quality, and addressing customer feedback promptly.
4. Optimize Product Mix:
Focus on high-demand items. The sales by items chart shows that fruits, snacks, and household items are the top-selling categories. Ensuring these items are always in stock and possibly expanding the range in these categories could drive more sales.
5. Expand Market Reach:
Target underperforming locations and outlet types. Tier 1 locations and grocery stores have lower sales compared to others. Marketing campaigns and promotions in these areas could help increase their sales.

Insights of the Dashboard :
1. Sales Distribution by Fat Content: Regular fat content items make up 64.6% of sales, while low-fat items account for 35.4%. This indicates a higher preference for regular fat content items among customers.
2. Sales by Outlet Size: Medium-sized outlets contribute the most to sales (42.27%), followed by small (37.01%) and high (20.72%) outlets. This suggests that medium-sized outlets are the most effective in generating sales.
3. Sales Trends Over Time: The sales by outlet establishment graph shows a significant increase in sales around 2018, followed by a slight decline. This trend can help in understanding the market dynamics and planning future strategies.
4. Fat Content by Location: Tier 3 locations have the highest sales of fat content items (3.4K), followed by Tier 2 (2.8K) and Tier 1 (2.4K). This information can be used to tailor marketing strategies based on location-specific preferences.
5. Sales Summary: The total sum of sales is ₹12,01,681.6, with Supermarket Type 1 leading in sales. This summary provides a quick overview of the overall performance and can help in identifying key areas for improvement.
